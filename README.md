# @firetower/cli

Install, upgrade and inspect a [Firetower](https://usefiretower.com) deployment.

```sh
npm i -g @firetower/cli
firetower install
```

## What it does

`firetower install` checks the machine before it writes anything, asks four
questions, generates the two secrets you would otherwise generate by hand, and
brings the stack up. It prints the administrator's password once and makes you
acknowledge the root key, because that key is the only unrecoverable thing here.

`firetower upgrade` pulls, recreates, waits for health — and then tells you which
of your machines are still running an older worker, naming each one and the
command to fix it. The control plane already compares its version against every
worker's on each handshake; this asks it, and turns the answer into something to
paste.

## Requirements

Docker, the Compose plugin, and Node 20 or newer on the machine you are
installing onto. Node comes with npm, which you needed to install this.

## Commands

```
firetower install              install the control plane on this machine
firetower upgrade              upgrade it, then report which workers lag
firetower status               version, health, hosts, worker drift
firetower doctor               diagnose a deployment that isn't working
firetower logs [service] [-f]  tail it
firetower start | stop | restart
firetower backup [--out DIR]   pg_dump plus the root key
firetower uninstall            tear it down, asking separately about volumes

firetower worker install       install a worker on THIS machine
firetower worker upgrade       drain-aware worker upgrade
firetower worker status

firetower --version            this CLI's version, and the deployed one
```

Global flags: `--dir <path>` (remembered after `install`), `--yes` for
unattended runs, `--json` on any command that answers a question.

## Unattended

```sh
firetower --yes install --domain firetower.example.com --admin-username admin
```

Generates the administrator password and writes the root key to
`firetower-root-key.txt` in the deployment directory, because there is nobody
there to read it off the terminal. Move it somewhere safe and delete it.

## Where the deployment files come from

`install` fetches `deploy/firetower.yml` and `deploy/Caddyfile` from the latest
release of
[firetower-cloud/firetower](https://github.com/firetower-cloud/firetower), so the
compose file always matches the images being pulled. Copies under `fallback/`
are used only when GitHub is unreachable, and the CLI says so when it uses them.

This is why they are not vendored: a copy that were authoritative would go
quietly out of step every time the main repository changed one.

## The rule this codebase is built around

**A value already in `.env` is never replaced.**

`FIRETOWER_ROOT_KEY` is why. Every credential Firetower holds is sealed with it,
so writing a new one over an existing database does not fail — it succeeds, and
every stored credential becomes undecryptable, and nothing says so until the next
clone. `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is the same mistake with a louder symptom: it is baked
into the data directory at initdb.

`src/env.ts` reads first and fills only what is absent. There are unit tests for
it and an end-to-end test that installs twice and asserts the key survived.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test          # fast, no Docker
pnpm test:e2e      # drives a real daemon; minutes
```

## Licence

AGPL-3.0-only, the same as Firetower.
